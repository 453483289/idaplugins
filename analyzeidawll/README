  ----------
  script parses "Funcset" and "Extfun" tables,
  renames and comments its elements for better
  readability. This will reveal (most of the)
  IDC functions that wrap SDK functions and
  some undocumented ones like _peek(), _lpoke(),
  _poke(), _time(), _call(), DecodeInstruction(),
  ____(), and others.
  If invoked at run-time (i.e. ida.wll during
  a debugging session), the script will also
  reveal IDC functions that have dynamically
  been added using the SDK's set_idc_func()
  functions.
