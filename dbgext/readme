Debugger Extensions
-------------------
This package is a collection of useful
IDC scripts for the Disassembler IDA PRO.
They extend the functionality of the integrated debugger. Their primary
usage is tracking user input, penetration testing and discovery of
vulnerabilities by examining a binary's runtime behavior.
Most of the scripts require IDA Pro 4.5
or above, since version 4.5 introduced
the integrated debugger.
